# Product Requirements Document: QR Code Scanning for Verification

## 1. Introduction/Overview

This document outlines the requirements for a new feature that enables users to scan a QR code using their mobile device's camera. When a user clicks the "Submit" button, the application will open a camera view in a modal dialog. After a QR code is successfully scanned, the application will automatically submit the form data along with the data extracted from the QR code. This feature is critical for verifying user actions, such as student check-ins, by ensuring they are physically present at a designated location.

## 2. Goals

*   To implement a seamless QR code scanning experience on mobile devices.
*   To verify user actions by capturing data from a QR code.
*   To improve the efficiency and accuracy of the check-in/check-out process.
*   To provide clear feedback to the user if camera access is denied.

## 3. User Stories

*   **As a student,** I want to scan a QR code with my phone's camera when I check in so that my location can be quickly and easily verified.
*   **As a school administrator,** I want the check-in form to be submitted automatically after a successful QR scan so that the process is fast and I can ensure data integrity.
*   **As a user,** I want to be clearly informed if the app needs camera access so that I understand why it's required and can grant permission.

## 4. Functional Requirements

1.  When the user taps the "Submit" button on a mobile device, the application **must** request access to the device's camera.
2.  The camera interface **must** be displayed in a full-screen modal dialog that overlays the current page.
3.  The application **must** be able to detect and decode a QR code from the camera feed.
4.  Upon a successful QR code scan, the application **must** automatically submit the current form data along with the data obtained from the QR code.
5.  The modal dialog **must** close automatically after the scan is complete and the data is submitted.
6.  If the user denies camera permission, the application **must** display an alert message stating that camera access is required to proceed.
7.  The alert message for denied permissions **must** be clear and user-friendly.

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

*   This feature will **not** be implemented for desktop web browsers. The functionality is intended for mobile devices (e.g., iPhone, iPad, Android) only.
*   The feature will **not** support capturing photos or recording videos. Its sole purpose is to scan QR codes.
*   The feature will **not** require the user to manually populate a form field with the QR code data; the submission is automatic.

## 6. Design Considerations

*   The camera view should be presented in a clean, unobstructed modal dialog.
*   A clear "cancel" or "close" button should be available on the modal to allow the user to exit the camera view without scanning.
*   The alert message for denied permissions should be implemented using the existing alert component (`AlertDialog`).

## 7. Technical Considerations

*   The feature should be implemented using a well-supported, mobile-friendly QR code scanning library for React/Next.js.
*   The implementation should gracefully handle different camera states, including "permission denied," "permission granted," and "no camera available."
*   The feature should be tested on both iOS (Safari) and Android (Chrome) devices.

## 8. Success Metrics

*   Successful QR code scans result in a valid data submission to Firestore.
*   A measurable decrease in the time it takes for a user to complete the check-in/check-out process.
*   Zero support tickets related to users being unable to scan a QR code on a mobile device.

## 9. Open Questions

*   What specific data format is expected from the QR code?
*   How should the application handle invalid or unexpected QR code data?
*   Is there a timeout for the camera session if no QR code is detected?
