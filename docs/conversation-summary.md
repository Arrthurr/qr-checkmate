# Conversation Summary: QR Checkmate Location Verification Feature

## Overview

This document summarizes the conversation regarding the development of a QR code scanning and location verification feature for the QR Checkmate app. The discussion covered defining the feature's requirements, designing the database structure for activity logs, and integrating Firebase Firestore into the application.
The development process followed the tasks outlined in the `tasks/prd-qr-location-verification.md` file.
## Key Decisions Made

*   **Feature Goal:** The primary goal of the feature is to verify that the user is at the correct school location using QR code scanning and geographical proximity.
*   **Validation Criteria:** A check-in is considered valid if:
    *   The scanned QR code matches the selected school.
    *   The user's current location is within 100 meters of the school's registered location.
*   **Permission Handling:** If camera or location permissions are denied, the app will display an error message and prevent the check-in/check-out action.
*   **Activity Log Storage:** Activity logs will be stored in a remote Firebase Firestore database.
*   **UI/UX:** The existing `qr-scanner-dialog.tsx` and `confirmation-dialog.tsx` components are sufficient for the initial implementation.
*   **Firebase Configuration:** Firebase configuration values will be stored in the `.env` file using `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefixes and accessed via `process.env`.

## Firestore Database Design for Activity Logs

A new collection named `activityLogs` was designed in Firestore. Each document in this collection represents a single log entry with the following fields:

*   `timestamp`: (Timestamp) Server timestamp when the log entry was created.
*   `fullName`: (String) Full name of the service provider.
*   `schoolName`: (String) Name of the school.
*   `action`: (String) "check-in" or "check-out".
*   `status`: (String) "success" or "failure".
*   `reason`: (String) Reason for the status (e.g., "Location verified", "QR Code Mismatch", "Not within proximity", "Location access denied", "Camera permission denied", "Could not retrieve location").

## Completed Tasks and Files Modified

The implementation involved completing the following parent tasks and their associated sub-tasks:

1.  **Implement QR Scanning and Initial Validation:** Handled camera permissions, implemented the QR scanner dialog, and performed initial validation of the scanned QR code against the selected school.
2.  **Implement Geolocation and Distance Calculation:** Implemented requesting and handling geolocation permissions, retrieving user and school coordinates, calculating the distance between them, and determining if the location is within the allowed proximity.
3.  **Integrate Firestore for Activity Logging:** Ensured Firebase initialization, verified the existence of the `activityLogs` collection, defined the `LogEntry` type, constructed and wrote `LogEntry` objects to Firestore for every attempt, and added basic error handling for write operations.
4.  **Update Activity Log Display:** Implemented functionality to fetch recent activity log entries from Firestore in real-time and modified the `ActivityLog` component to display this data, including adding a loading state.
5.  **Implement Error Handling and User Feedback:** Ensured clear error messages for permissions and other issues were displayed using toasts and the confirmation dialog. The confirmation dialog now shows the final status and reason for each attempt. Visual indicators were added while processing.

All tests passed after the completion of each parent task, and the changes were committed to the repository.

*   `tasks/prd-qr-location-verification.md`: Created a Product Requirements Document outlining the feature details.
*   `.env`: Updated to include Firebase configuration variables with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefixes.
*   `src/app/page.tsx`:
    *   Initialized the Firebase app and Firestore database instance using the environment variables.
    *   Contains the core logic for QR scanning, geolocation, distance calculation, Firestore logging, and state management for the UI components.
*   `src/lib/utils.ts`: Implemented the `calculateDistance` utility function.
*   `src/lib/utils.test.ts`: Added unit tests for the `calculateDistance` function.
*   `src/lib/types.ts`: Defined the `LogEntry` TypeScript type.
*   `src/components/activity-log.tsx`: Modified to accept and display data fetched from Firestore and added a loading indicator.
*   `babel.config.js`: Added for Babel configuration for Jest.
*   `jest.config.js`: Added for Jest test configuration.
*   `jest.setup.js`: Added for Jest setup.

## Next Steps

1.  **Verify Firebase Connection:** Test the app in the development environment to confirm successful connection to the Firebase project and that activity logs are being written to Firestore.
2.  **Implement Data Fetching:** Add functionality to `src/app/page.tsx` (or a dedicated component) to fetch activity log data from the Firestore `activityLogs` collection.
3.  **Update Activity Log Display:** Modify the `ActivityLog` component (`src/components/activity-log.tsx`) to display the data fetched from Firestore instead of the local state.
4.  **Implement Pagination/Filtering:** Consider implementing pagination or filtering for the activity log display as the data grows.
5.  **Review and Refine:** Review the implemented feature against the PRD and make any necessary refinements based on testing and feedback.
