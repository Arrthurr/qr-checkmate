# Conversation Summary: QR Checkmate Location Verification Feature

## Overview

This document summarizes the conversation regarding the development of a QR code scanning and location verification feature for the QR Checkmate app. The discussion covered defining the feature's requirements, designing the database structure for activity logs, and integrating Firebase Firestore into the application.

## Key Decisions Made

*   **Feature Goal:** The primary goal of the feature is to verify that the user is at the correct school location using QR code scanning and geographical proximity.
*   **Validation Criteria:** A check-in is considered valid if:
    *   The scanned QR code matches the selected school.
    *   The user's current location is within 100 meters of the school's registered location.
*   **Permission Handling:** If camera or location permissions are denied, the app will display an error message and prevent the check-in/check-out action.
*   **Activity Log Storage:** Activity logs will be stored in a remote Firebase Firestore database.
*   **UI/UX:** The existing `qr-scanner-dialog.tsx` and `confirmation-dialog.tsx` components are sufficient for the initial implementation.
*   **Firebase Configuration:** Firebase configuration values will be stored in the `.env` file using `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefixes and accessed via `process.env`.

## Firestore Database Design for Activity Logs

A new collection named `activityLogs` was designed in Firestore. Each document in this collection represents a single log entry with the following fields:

*   `timestamp`: (Timestamp) Server timestamp when the log entry was created.
*   `fullName`: (String) Full name of the service provider.
*   `schoolName`: (String) Name of the school.
*   `action`: (String) "check-in" or "check-out".
*   `status`: (String) "success" or "failure".
*   `reason`: (String) Reason for the status (e.g., "Location verified", "QR Code Mismatch", "Not within proximity", "Location access denied").

## Files Modified

*   `tasks/prd-qr-location-verification.md`: Created a Product Requirements Document outlining the feature details.
*   `.env`: Updated to include Firebase configuration variables with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefixes.
*   `src/app/page.tsx`:
    *   Modified the `addLogEntry` function to write data to the `activityLogs` Firestore collection using `addDoc` and `serverTimestamp()`.
    *   Initialized the Firebase app and Firestore database instance using the environment variables.
    *   Removed the local state update for logs within `addLogEntry`.
    *   Removed the placeholder comment for Firebase configuration.

## Next Steps

1.  **Verify Firebase Connection:** Test the app in the development environment to confirm successful connection to the Firebase project and that activity logs are being written to Firestore.
2.  **Implement Data Fetching:** Add functionality to `src/app/page.tsx` (or a dedicated component) to fetch activity log data from the Firestore `activityLogs` collection.
3.  **Update Activity Log Display:** Modify the `ActivityLog` component (`src/components/activity-log.tsx`) to display the data fetched from Firestore instead of the local state.
4.  **Implement Pagination/Filtering:** Consider implementing pagination or filtering for the activity log display as the data grows.
5.  **Review and Refine:** Review the implemented feature against the PRD and make any necessary refinements based on testing and feedback.
